## Projects

### Six-Cell Battery Management System (BMS) PCBA

Six-cell voltage measurement, passive balancing, coulomb-counting SOC modelling, UV/OV protection, and bidirectional charge/discharge switching. Designed after self-studying BMS principles.

### Micro Tunnel Boring Machine (MTBM)

Developed during my time on Penn Hyperloop. Half-meter diameter tunnel boring machine that uses a 10kW AC induction motor to torque a two-inch thick steel cutterhead, and a 15kW AC induction motor to generate over 60,000lbs of propulsion force.
