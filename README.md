## Work Experience
**Undergraduate Researcher, KumarRobotics (_Jan 2025 - Present_)**
- Joined the Distributed and Collaborative Systems and Technology (DCIST) team to develop hardware and software for swarm technology alongside the Army Research Laboratory
- Leading development of a “brain in a box” that uses LiDAR, GPS, stereo cameras, IMU readings, and an on-board Linux machine for adaptable sensor fusion, data collection, and autonomy algorithm deployment for mid-size UGVs (~800lbs)
- Developing skills in ROS, MATLAB, and Python (Numpy, Pandas) to design, simulate, and analyze multi-agent robotic systems


**Head of Electrical Controls, Penn Hyperloop (_Aug 2023 - Jan 2025_)**
- Worked with team to build half-meter diameter tunnel boring machine (TBM) and won the 2024 Not-A-Boring-Competition mini event
- Developed state-based control system for the tunnel boring machine, using PLCs and VFDs to coordinate multi-parameter systems in a dynamic, GPS-denied environment
- Modeled TBM cutterhead using Fusion360 CAD software, used static stress FEA for bolt sizing
- Presented team at the 2024 North American Tunneling (NAT) conference in Nashville, TN

**Electrical Hardware Engineer, Penn Electric Racing (_Aug 2023 - June 2024_)**
- Designed and routed high-voltage CCCV battery charger using Altium Designer to quintuple max current and improve charging characteristics
- Designed and routed a Brake Sensor Plausibility Device (BSPD), which aggregates motor and brake sensor data to ensure nominal and safe car behavior
- Gained hands-on experience using oscilloscopes, multimeters, and lab-bench power supplies

**Computer Engineer, BitMindz (_Summer 2024_)**
- Assembled high-power workstations for forensic processing applications, coordinated sales to CIA, FBI, United States Secret Service, and NSA
- Modeled custom brackets using Solidworks CAD, which increased rate of airflow boosting system performance by 26%
- Created automated 3D printer farm using custom Raspberry Pi software, increasing rate of custom component manufacturing by ~3x


**Intern, First Reserve Corp. (_Summer 2022_)**
- Youngest intern ever hired
- Conducted research on the autonomous pipeline pigging robotics industry, evaluated for potential roll-up
- Modeled an LBO to track IRR and MoIC on various performance cases
- Consolidated information onto a memo and presented to senior management


## Projects

### Six-Cell Battery Management System (BMS) PCBA

Six-cell voltage measurement, passive balancing, coulomb-counting SOC modelling, UV/OV protection, and bidirectional charge/discharge switching. Designed after self-studying BMS principles.

### Micro Tunnel Boring Machine (MTBM)

Developed during my time on Penn Hyperloop. Half-meter diameter tunnel boring machine that uses a 10kW AC induction motor to torque a two-inch thick steel cutterhead, and a 15kW AC induction motor to generate over 60,000lbs of propulsion force.

### 1300W Electronic Speed Controller

ESC to drive a 1300W, 36A Brushless DC Motor (BLDC). It utilizes a three-phase MOSFET inverter, ATMEGA328P microcontroller, FOC implementation, and USB to serial UART translation for programming and bootloading.

### Autonomous Quadcopter

3D-printed quadcopter for autonomous navigation testing. It uses an Arduino Uno for low-level motor control commands, and an Nvidia Jetson Nano for high-level navigation and communication functionality.
